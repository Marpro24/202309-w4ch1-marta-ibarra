      <h2> Ch1. First day of class </h2>
      <p>
        In a bustling college classroom, 17 eager students gathered on their first day of class. Nervous laughter and
        excited
        chatter filled the air as they introduced themselves, their voices a symphony of diverse backgrounds and
        aspirations.
        Each name and face represented a unique story waiting to unfold in this academic journey, where strangers would
        soon
        become friends, and where the adventure of higher education was about to begin.
