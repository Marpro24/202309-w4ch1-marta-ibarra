    <h2>Ch.1: Classroom Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      In Chapter 4, the college students face their first academic challenges. The professor assigns a complex project that
      requires teamwork and critical thinking. As they work together to overcome obstacles and solve problems, they learn more
      about each other's strengths and weaknesses. Tensions arise, but they ultimately discover the power of collaboration and
      perseverance. This chapter highlights the growth and resilience of the group as they navigate their academic journey.
