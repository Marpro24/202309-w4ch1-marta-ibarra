    <h2>Ch.1: Classroom Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      In Chapter 4, the college students face their first academic challenges. The professor assigns a complex project
      that
      requires teamwork and critical thinking. As they work together to overcome obstacles and solve problems, they
      learn more
      about each other's strengths and weaknesses. Tensions arise, but they ultimately discover the power of
      collaboration and
      perseverance. This chapter highlights the growth and resilience of the group as they navigate their academic
      journey.

      Ch.2: Late-Night Study Sessions
    </h2>
    <p>
      Chapter 5 explores the evolving dynamics within the group. Late-night study sessions become a regular occurrence
      as
      midterms approach. In the dimly lit library and dorm rooms, friendships deepen as students bond over shared
      academic
      struggles and late-night snacks. Through laughter, exhaustion, and a few well-timed coffee runs, they form a
      tight-knit
      support system, proving that their college experience is about more than just grades.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Chapter 6 marks the end of the semester, and the students celebrate their first milestones together. With exams
      completed and projects submitted, they gather for a memorable end-of-term party. Through speeches, toasts, and
      shared
      stories, they reflect on their growth as individuals and as a group. This chapter captures the sense of
      accomplishment
      and camaraderie that has developed throughout their time together, setting the stage for the next chapter of their
      college adventure.
