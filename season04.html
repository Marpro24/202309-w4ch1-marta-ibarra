    <h2>
      Ch.1: The Mid-College Crisis
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Chapter 10, the students find themselves at the midpoint of their college journey, facing the so-called
      "mid-college
      crisis." They reflect on their academic majors and career aspirations, questioning if they're on the right path.
      Some
      consider changing majors, while others seek internships and guidance from professors. This chapter explores the
      challenges of finding one's true calling and the support they offer each other during this period of
      self-discovery.
