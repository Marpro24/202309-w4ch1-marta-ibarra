      Ch.1 The Summer Break
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Episode 7, summer break arrives, and the college students disperse to different corners of the world. Some
      embark on
      internships, while others travel or return home. They stay connected through video calls, sharing their diverse
      experiences and adventures. This episode explores how the bonds they've formed continue to grow even when they're
      physically apart, as they support each other's endeavors and look forward to reuniting for the next semester.
