    <h2> Ch1. First day of class </h2>
    <p>
      In a bustling college classroom, 17 eager students gathered on their first day of class. Nervous laughter and
      excited
      chatter filled the air as they introduced themselves, their voices a symphony of diverse backgrounds and
      aspirations.
      Each name and face represented a unique story waiting to unfold in this academic journey, where strangers would
      soon
      become friends, and where the adventure of higher education was about to begin.

    <h2> Ch2 The Icebreaker </h2>
    <p>
      In Chapter 2, the college students embark on an icebreaker activity. The professor, eager to foster connections
      among
      the class, assigns a fun and interactive exercise. As students pair up and engage in conversations, they discover
      shared
      interests and surprising commonalities. Bonds begin to form, breaking the initial barriers of unfamiliarity, and
      the
      classroom atmosphere becomes warmer and more welcoming.
