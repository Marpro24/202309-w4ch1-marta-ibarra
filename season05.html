    </h2>
    <p>      
      In Chapter 13, the college seniors dive into their culminating senior projects. They dedicate themselves to their chosen
      research, creative endeavors, or thesis topics, working tirelessly to showcase their growth and knowledge over the
      years. The stress and excitement of completing their final academic assignments bring them even closer together as they
      offer each other support, feedback, and encouragement.
