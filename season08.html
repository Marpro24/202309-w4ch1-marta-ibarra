      <h2> Ch1. First day of class </h2>
      <p>
        In a bustling college classroom, 17 eager students gathered on their first day of class. Nervous laughter and
        excited
        chatter filled the air as they introduced themselves, their voices a symphony of diverse backgrounds and
        aspirations.
        Each name and face represented a unique story waiting to unfold in this academic journey, where strangers would
        soon
        become friends, and where the adventure of higher education was about to begin.

        <h2> Ch2 The Icebreaker </h2>
        <p>
          In Chapter 2, the college students embark on an icebreaker activity. The professor, eager to foster connections
          among
          the class, assigns a fun and interactive exercise. As students pair up and engage in conversations, they discover
          shared
          interests and surprising commonalities. Bonds begin to form, breaking the initial barriers of unfamiliarity, and
          the
          classroom atmosphere becomes warmer and more welcoming.
